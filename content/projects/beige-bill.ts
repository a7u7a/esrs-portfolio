  descriptionOne: `I was tasked with building the design system for BeigePill's new website, designed by [FutureCorp](https://futurecorp.paris/). Starting from a simple concept and developing it into a performant, full-screen animation.`,
  descriptionTwo: `The current approach uses WebGL's [stencil buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_buffer) to create the mask and [GSAP](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/) to control it. Enabling Beige Pill to present their work in line with their premium brand identity. Special thanks to [Jack Wild](https://isjackwild.com/) for his technical guidance.`,
